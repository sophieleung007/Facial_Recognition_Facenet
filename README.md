# Facial_Recognition_Facenet

This repository contains a facial recognition project using the Facenet model with RMSprop optimization, converted to a Python script.

## Features
- Trains a neural network with RMSprop for facial recognition.
- Uses InceptionResnetV1 for embedding extraction.
- Implements facial matching with a confidence threshold.

## Usage
- Run the script locally with Python to perform facial recognition.
- Model saved to Google Drive for deployment (update path as needed).

## Files
- [Augmented_0_3_RMSprop_Training_Facenet_.py](https://github.com/sophieleung007/Facial_Recognition_Facenet/blob/main/Augmented_0_3_RMSprop_Training_Facenet_.py)

## Note
- Interactive widgets from the original notebook are not included; run the script with an image path for testing.
