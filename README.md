# Facial_Recognition_Facenet

This repository contains a facial recognition project using the Facenet model with RMSprop optimization. The project includes training and inference code implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Features
- Trains a neural network with RMSprop for facial recognition.
- Uses InceptionResnetV1 for embedding extraction.
- Implements facial matching with a confidence threshold.
- Includes visualization of bounding boxes on detected faces.

## Usage
- Upload an image via the notebook's widget to test facial matching.
- Model saved to Google Drive for deployment.
